                    A 2D/3D floor planning application providing the opportunity to sketch and explore reality. Scribe
                    allows a user to sketch a property, collect data on-site and produce a VR floor plan that can be
                    edited by anyone, anywhere. In this project as part of a team I have written efficient and reusable
                    code that drove complex logics in order of bringing suggestions from an idea to life.

                    OOX AR is an innovative multiplayer augmented reality game. With the use of mobile phone camera
                    users will feel as being on the playground. This game was created with intention of experimenting
                    with computer generated space from multiple sources. NFC (Near Field Communication) and QR Codes are
                    used in this game to connect players within the same space. In this project I have worked alone.

                    A new take on the classic 3 dice game featuring 3D physics driven dice. In this project I was
                    involved as a solo programmer. The idea behind this game is to kill zombies and rack up points
                    however zombie attacks are there to stop the user on doing so.

                    This is my first fully released game, and in this game I have done everything on my own except
                    music. A game character called Zippy is lost in void, this character moves at sonic speed but the
                    terrain is not on his side, so he needs our help. Along the way users will rescue Zippy by sliding
                    in straight paths, turns, hills and stairs. By dodging users can collect tokens and use them in the
                    store. The void is endless as are the surprises.

                    In this research and development project my intention was to explore new ways of using projection

                    mapping, user interaction and optical illusion where techniques used to give the audience an

                    This is an audio-visual project where light and sound are used to create a glimpse of non-reality.
                    The idea of the project was to create confusion, disorder where everything is unknown but
                    simultaneously everything make sense. In this ambient where the viewer is truly connected with the
                    generative world, the perception of reality is truly unneeded, lost.
